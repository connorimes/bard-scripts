Scripts for evaluating Bard.

Author: Connor Imes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Library code repositories at:

Bard
  https://github.com/libpoet/bard
Heartbeats 2.0
  https://github.com/libheartbeats/heartbeats
  (Checkout the "bard" branch for hb-energy-odroid that works on ODROID-XU3 systems)

Note: you may have to run "sudo ldconfig" after running "sudo make install" for Heartbeats and Bard libraries.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Benchmark patches at:

http://poet.cs.uchicago.edu/

In benchmark Makefiles (and in PARSEC's "config/gcc-hooks-poet.bldconf"), replace "-lhb-energy-msr" as necessary (e.g. with "-lhb-energy-odroid -lpthread").

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project contains the following scripts:

apps/*/power-control/pre-run.sh
  Application-specific configurations.
  You will need to change the location of the binary and any inputs passed as arguments to it to match your system setup.

powerQoS/
  Third-party python utilities for communicating with an external WattsUp power meter.
  This is not used by default.

bard_init_state.sh
  Used by other scripts to initialize the system configuration to the maximum specified by "/etc/poet/cpu_config".

bard_perf_target.sh
  Run an application with a performance target (like POET).

bard_pwr_target.sh
  Run an application with a power target (new to Bard).

bard_switch_pwr_perf_targets.sh
  Run an application with a performance target, then switch to a power target (application must support this runtime check).

bard_targets.sh
  Run an application with a set of performance or power targets.

cpufreq-all-set-governor.sh
  Set the DVFS governor on all cores (sets "ondemand" by default).

hb_cleanup.sh
  Cleanup shared memory

results_to_bard.sh
  Process a results file to produce "control_config" and "cpu_config" files for Bard (by default, Bard looks for them in "/etc/poet/").

shmoo.sh
  Characterize an application by running in all system configurations.

shmoo-odroidxu3.sh
  Characterize an application by running in all system configurations.
  The ODROID-XU3 has a non-standard environment, hence the need for this separate script.
  Note: The script does not characterize both big and LITTLE cores automatically - modify the script to set the "USE_BIG" value to 0 or 1 to switch between the LITTLE and big cores.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additional Notes:

Before you can use Bard, you must install configs - default ones can be found in the Bard source and manually copied to "/etc/poet/":
  sudo mkdir -p /etc/poet
  sudo cp config/default/* /etc/poet
